`examples/`: Example Notebooks
========

The "formal" example notebooks start with numbers (starting from 00). These notebooks are
intended to be followed sequentially. They are tested and so are expected to work.

The other notebooks in this directory are "informal" and are a random collection which may be out of date and are not tested. These notebooks are not necessarily expected to work.

The notebooks in `developer/` are intended as an introduction to `pywatershed` development, 
specifically setting up and running the `autotest/` tests. At the moment, these notebooks are
not tested and may be out of date.
