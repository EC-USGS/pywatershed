# Version 2.0.0 Extended Release Notes

These are the extended release notes. The official release notes are found
[here](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/releases/tag/2.0.0).

## Purpose and scope of pywatershed version 2.0.0

These notes summarize the more detailed [What's New for version 2.0.0](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/whats-new.html#v2-0-0-16-december-2024) in the documentation.

### FlowGraph
The primary new capability introduced is the [`FlowGraph`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.FlowGraph.html) and its related classes.
The `FlowGraph` allow users to combine different kinds flow solutions on [`FlowNodes`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.FlowNode.html) in
arbitrary order.

In the figure below, a node of class B is inserted into the original graph. Class B may have a different flow solution than class A nodes in the original graph, but FlowGraph
will handle new FlowNodes wherever you want to put them. FlowGraph checks mass balance over the graph.

While `FlowGraph`s may be constructed from scratch, a common use case
(demonstrated in a new example notebook,
[06_flow_graph_starfit.ipynb](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/blob/develop/examples/06_flow_graph_starfit.ipynb))
is to add a reservoir representation
into an existing `FlowGraph` which is equivalent to `PRMSChannel`, using [`PRMSChannelFlowNode`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.PRMSChannelFlowNode.html). The STARFIT
reservoir representation is implemented as [`StarfitFlowNode`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.StarfitFlowNode.html) which can be added into
the `FlowGraph`. Other `FlowNodes` implemented are [`PassThroughFlowNode`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.PassThroughFlowNode.html) and
[`ObsInFlowNode`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.ObsInFlowNode.html). The second reproduces the "obsin" capabilities present in PRMS.
Please see the [`FlowGraph` documentation](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.FlowGraph.html) (linked throughout above) for additional details.


### Additional PRMS functionality
- Subclasses of PRMSRunoff, PRMSSoilzone, and PRMSGroundwater are available
  which do not include depression storage: PRMSRunoffNoDprst, PRMSSoilzoneNoDprst, and PRMSGroundwaterNoDprst.
- Dunnian flow is implemented in PRMSSoilzone and is 2-way coupled to PRMSRunoff.
- Preferential flow is implemented in PRMSSoilzone.


### MmrToMf6Dfw
The [`MmrToMf6Dfw`](https://pywatershed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/pywatershed.MmrToMf6Dfw.html)
class builds a MF6 1-D channel (CHF) simulation using diffusive wave
(DFW) routing from PRMS NHM input files and a few simple assumptions. The
lateral (to-channel) fluxes from a PRMS run are used as time varying boundary
conditions. A new example notebook
([07_mmr_to_mf6_chf_dfw.ipynb](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/blob/develop/examples/07_mmr_to_mf6_chf_dfw.ipynb))
runs the Delaware River Basin using MF6 CFH-DFW based on PRMS input files.


### Breaking Changes
The parameter `pref_flow_infil_frac` is now a required parameter input for PRMSSoilzone. The
NHM values assumed previously are zeros on all HRUs.
