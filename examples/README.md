The notebooks are numbered and at least the first 2 (00 and 01) should be executed first. 

* `00_python_virtual_env.ipynb`: Get up and running using conda to get all the dependencies. 
* `01_automated_testing.ipynb`: Run PRMS and convert outputs to NetCDF to have input data.
* `02_process_models.ipynb`: Use pynhm to model!
