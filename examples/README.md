Notebooks starting with numbers are "offical" and are tested using continuous integration.
These are listed below. The remaning notebooks are informal and may be out of date, use
with caution and lowered expectations.

The first two notebooks (00 and 01) setup the environment and testing data that may be used
in later notebooks and should be executed first.

* `00_python_virtual_env.ipynb`: Get up and running using conda to get all the dependencies.
* `01_automated_testing.ipynb`: Run PRMS and convert outputs to NetCDF to have input data.
* `02_process_models.ipynb`: Use pywatershed to model!
