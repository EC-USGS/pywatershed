## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to refactor and redesign the [PRMS modeling
system](https://www.usgs.gov/software/precipitation-runoff-modeling-system-prms)
while maintaining its functionality. Code modernization is a step towards
unification with [MODFLOW 6 (MF6)](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6).

The following motivations are taken from our [AGU poster from December
2022](https://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=05-E1-C6-40-DF-0D-4D-C7-4E-DE-D2-61-02-05-8F-0A)
which provides additional details on motivations, project status, and current
directions of this project as of approximately January 2023.

Goals of the USGS Enterprise Capacity (EC) project include: * A sustainable
integrated, hydrologic modeling framework for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
* Interoperable modeling across the USGS, partner agencies, and academia

Goals for EC Watershed Modeling: * Couple the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling
System (PRMS, e.g. Regan et al, 2018)  with MODFLOW 6 (MF6, e.g. Langevin et al,
2017) in a sustainable way * Redesign PRMS to be more modern and flexible *
Prioritize process representations in the current National Hydrological Model
(NHM) based on PRMS 5.2.1

Prototype an EC watershed model: "pywatershed" * Redesign PRMS quickly in python
* Couple to MF6 via BMI/XMI interface (Hughes et al, 2021; Hutton et al, 2020) *
Establish a prototyping ground for EC codes that couples to the compiled
framework: low cost proof of concepts (at the price of potentially less
computational performance) * Enable process representation hypothesis testing *
Use cutting-edge techniques and technologies to improve models * Machine
learning, automatic differentiation * Address challenges of modeling across
space and time scales * Transition prototype watershed model to compiled EC code

## Installation

To install the software you will need Python 3.9 or 3.10.

We currently recommend dependencies be installed with
[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will be much faster than
Ananconda (but the conda command can also be used). An environment containing
all core and optional dependencies can be created from the project root with:

```mamba env create -f environment_w_jupyter.yml```

(The environment `environment.yml` does not contain jupyter or jupyterlab
in order to not interfere with installation in WholeTale, see Example
Notebooks seection below.)

The `pywatershed` package is [available on
PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pywatershed/). At the moment, the installation
may not be reliable on all platforms and we are working to fix this.

Using PyPI (with the above caveat), `pywatershed` can be installed with:

``` pip install pywatershed ```

A number of extra dependencies are needed to run the example notebooks. These
can be installed with pip with

``` pip install "pywatershed[optional]" ```

These installation steps are suitable for `pywatershed` end users. See the
[developer documentation](./DEVELOPER.md) for detailed instructions on
configuring a development environment.

## Contributing

See the [developer documentation](./DEVELOPER.md) for instructions on setting up
a development environment. See the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to
contribute to this project.

## Example Notebooks

For introductory example notebooks, look in the
[`examples/`](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/tree/main/examples>)
directory in the repository. Numbered starting at 00, these are meant to be
completed in order. Non-numbered notebooks coveradditional topics. These
notebooks are note yet covered by testing and so may be expected to have some
issues until they are added to testing. In `examples/developer/` there are
notebooks of interest to developers who may want to learn about running the
software tests.

Though no notebook outputs are saved in Github, these notebooks can easily
navigated to and run in WholeTale containers (free but sign-up or log-in
required). This is a very easy and quick way to get started without needing to
install pywatershed requirements yourself. WholeTale is an NSF funded project
and supports logins from many institutions, e.g. the USGS, and you may not need
to register.

There are containers for both the `main` and `develop` branches.

[![WholeTale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whole-tale/wt-design-docs/master/badges/wholetale-explore.svg)](https://dashboard.wholetale.org)
* [WholeTale container for latest release (main
  branch)](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/run/64ae29e8a887f48b9f173678?tab=metadata)
* [WholeTale container for develop
  branch](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/run/64ae25c3a887f48b9f1735c8?tab=metadata)

WholeTale will give you a jupyter-lab running in the root of this
repository. You can navigate to `examples/` and then open and run the notebooks
of your choice.  The develop container may require the user to update the
repository (`git pull origin`) to stay current with development.
