    "## Requirements: Anaconda (or pip)\n",
    "To follow this notebook, you'll need to have conda installed (Anaconda or Miniconda). You may elect to use pip instead of conda for installing dependencies, and there is a note below on this. However [installing Anaconda or Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) is recommended for a variety of reasons. On windows we note that we used gitbash with conda installed. \n",

    "We can get the raw file containing the list of our dependencies for conda from the URL listed in the first line below. We then remove an existing environment (take care!) named \"pynhm_nb\" and install envrionment to this name based on what is in the file. This code is to be run in a bash shell on your machine and not in this notebook. In general, conda installs can take some time, so please be prepared to wait when installing from conda commands. (This took about 5-6 min for me to complete). Then we examine the versions we installed of several executables\n",
