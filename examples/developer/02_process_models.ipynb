    "The representation of \"individual\" physical processes in the model is fundamental. In pynhm we aim to make individual processes distinct units of code which can be run individually, assuming their inputs can be found. In our re-expression of PRMS, there are 8 \"indivdial\" processes (I keep putting \"individual\" in quotes because there are certainly debates over what that means and if processes are always aggregations of other processes. Effectively, the individual processes are conceptualizations that are useful for certain applications.) These are (with associated pynhm class names in parentheses):\n",

Relative to this we know where our test data are and we use that to assign the `domain_dir` variable, which is where our control and parameter files are found for running our model domain. We chose to use the \"drb_2yr\" domain for this model. For our `input_dir` we selected the `output` subdirectory of the domain directory. What we are using here is saying we want to look for our inputs among the PRMS outputs. That is we want to drive our stream channel model with fluxes calculated by PRMS. We can illustrate that with with the following code. "

It's inputs are mass flux volumes from groundwater (gwres_flow_vol), surface runoff (sroff_vol), and the subsurface reservoir (ssres_flow_vol). The files use for these inputs are those fluxes calculated by PRMS (in this case they've been converted to volumes instead of inches output natively by PRMS). We are using the PRMS calculated values out of convenience, but also because if our `pywatershed.PRMSChannel` process representation matches that of PRMS, our outputs will be identical. We will verify that momentarily. Also of note in the plot are the mass balance/budget terms outlined in blue. Stream channel has a \"global\" budget which is calculate over the entire spatial domain whereas HRU-based processes track a budget on each HRU. \n",
