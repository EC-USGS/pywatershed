# Design notes

A ledger of design problems observed while working on the code. Each
entry records a concrete case: the symptom, what it took to work
around, and the root cause in one line. The aim is to accumulate
enough cases to weigh design options against evidence, not to fix
anything here. Add entries as they arise.

## Process variants as subclasses

A physics option (depression storage on or off, cascades on or off,
agriculture on or off) is expressed as a subclass of a process, and
the parent's `__init__` does the wiring from declarations the child
must override in several places at once. Two consequences recur:

- **Declarations are spread and unchecked.** An input lives in the
  `__init__` signature, its docstring, `get_inputs()`, and the
  `super().__init__()` forward. Restart variables, init values, and
  parameters have the same shape. Nothing checks that they agree.
- **The parent decides things the child needs to veto or pre-empt.**
  The instance name, kernel parallelization, and how `None` inputs
  are filled are all set in the parent from the parent's point of view.

The cost also compounds: three binary options already give
`PRMSRunoff`, `PRMSRunoffNoDprst`, `PRMSRunoffCascadesNoDprst`, and
`PRMSRunoffAg`; each new option doubles the number of leaf classes.

### Cases

- **`stream_seg_in` accepted and silently dropped** (PR 407, B13).
  `PRMSSoilzone` and `PRMSSoilzoneNoDprst` took it in `__init__` but
  neither listed it in `get_inputs()`, so `_set_inputs` ignored it.
  Only `PRMSSoilzoneCascadesNoDprst` uses it, forwarding through the
  parent's signature. Workaround: a guard in `Process._set_inputs`
  that raises on any argument naming a model variable that is not in
  `self.inputs`. Root cause: declarations spread and unchecked.
- **Parents guard `self.name` with `hasattr`** (PR 407, B6). Cascade
  children set `self.name` before calling `super().__init__()`, and
  the parent overwrote it. Workaround: `if not hasattr(self, "name")`
  in `PRMSRunoff` and `PRMSSoilzone`. The guard only works before
  `super().__init__()`, because `Process.__init__` sets a default
  name; placed after it, both parents were named `Process` and
  collided on their budget output file (found 2026-09-04). Root
  cause: parent decides.
- **`_nb_parallel_ok` class attribute** (PR 407, B2). Cascade kernels
  must never run under numba `prange`, but the parent chooses the
  kernel's parallel flag. Workaround: a class attribute, True on
  parents and False on cascade children, and-ed into the decision.
  Root cause: parent decides.
- **`None` inputs filled with zeros for no-dprst children.**
  `prms_soilzone.py` (search "hacky dprst_flag == False approach")
  replaces every `None` input with a zero array when `_dprst_flag` is
  False, because the child passes `dprst_evap_hru=None` and
  `dprst_seep_hru=None` through a signature that still requires them.
  `prms_groundwater.py` has the same loop for `dprst_seep_hru`.
  Root cause: parent decides, and declarations spread.
- **Depression-storage restart variables on a no-dprst class.**
  `PRMSRunoffCascadesNoDprst.get_restart_variables` lists `dprst_*`
  variables the class does not carry. Restart is not expected for
  the cascade processes at all; their signatures have no
  `restart_read` or `restart_write`. Root cause: declarations spread.
- **Copy-paste `_calculate`** (PR 407 review, Quality). The cascade
  children repeat their NoDprst siblings' ~90-keyword kernel call
  almost verbatim (`prms_runoff_cascades_no_dprst.py` vs
  `prms_runoff_no_dprst.py`; same for soilzone). Every change to a
  kernel signature is hand-mirrored in three places; PR 407 made one.
  Not worked around. Root cause: parent decides (the parent owns the
  kernel call, so a child can only replace it, not extend it).
- **Doubled startup work** (PR 407 review, Quality). The cascade
  children rerun `_set_inputs`, `_set_options`, `_set_budget` and
  `basin_init` after `super().__init__()` already ran them
  (`prms_runoff_cascades_no_dprst.py`, search `basin_init`; soilzone
  reruns `_set_budget`), because the child must preprocess parameters
  before the parent wires them and the parent's `__init__` cannot be
  entered halfway. `preprocess_cascade_params` also runs once per
  class, so twice per model (three times with the groundwater cascade
  class, feat_gw_cascades). Not worked around. Root cause: parent
  decides.
- **Two off-switch conventions for one option** (PR 407 review,
  Quality). `PRMSRunoff` turns cascades off with per-step NaN sentinel
  arrays (`prms_runoff.py`, search `nan_array`) plus a compiled dummy
  kernel, and re-derives the flag each step from
  `np.isnan(ncascade_hru).all()`; `PRMSSoilzone` passes `None`. The
  parent's kernel carries arguments only the child fills. Not worked
  around. Root cause: declarations spread (the option lives in the
  kernel signature of a class that does not have the option).
- **A child's input threaded through the parent's signature**
  (feat_gw_cascades, 2026-09-09). `PRMSGroundwater.__init__` gained
  `stream_seg_in: adaptable = None` that the parent never reads,
  because `Process._set_inputs(locals())` runs inside the parent's
  `__init__`, so any input of a child must be an argument of the
  parent. `PRMSSoilzone` already had the same shape for the same
  variable (first case above); the B13 guard is what keeps the
  parent from silently dropping it. Root cause: declarations spread.
- **Third convention for `self.name`** (feat_gw_cascades,
  2026-09-09). `PRMSGroundwater` has no `hasattr` guard, so
  `PRMSGroundwaterCascadesNoDprst` sets `self.name` *after*
  `super().__init__()` and reruns `_set_budget` so the budget carries
  the child's name; the runoff and soilzone children set it *before*
  and rely on the guard. Same problem, now solved two ways. Root
  cause: parent decides.
