.. _whats-new.2.0.0:

v2.0.0 (14 November 2024)
---------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The :class:`FlowGraph` capabilities are introduced. These allow users to
  combine different kinds flow solutions in arbitrary order on a "flow graph".
  The accompanying base classes :class:`FlowNode` and :class:`FlowNodeMaker`
  are introduced along with their subclasses for modeling
  :class:`PassThroughFlowNode`\ s, :class:`ObsInFlowNode`\ s (flow replacement by
  observations with sink and source tracking in mass balance),
  :class:`PRMSChannelFlowNode`\ s, and :class:`StarfitFlowNode`\ s. A new
  example notebook,
  `examples/06_flow_graph_starfit.ipynb <https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/blob/develop/examples/06_flow_graph_starfit.ipynb>`__
  demonstrates adding STARFIT reservoir nodes into a FlowGraph otherwise
  simulating `PRMSChannel` and highlights helper functions for this use case.
  (:pull:`233`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- The :class:`MmrToMf6Dfw` class builds a MF6 simulation with Diffusive Wave
  (DFW) routing from PRMS NHM input files and a few simple assumptions. The
  lateral (to-channel) fluxes from a PRMS are used as time varying boundary
  conditions. A new notebook runs the Delaware River Basin using MF6 DFW:
  `examples/07_mmr_to_mf6_chf_dfw.ipynb <https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/blob/develop/examples/07_mmr_to_mf6_chf_dfw.ipynb>`__.
  (:pull:`290`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- No depression storage subclasses are available for PRMSRunoff, PRMSSoilzone,
  and PRMSGroundwater by adding "NoDprst" to the end of the names. Depression
  storage is switched off in sagehen_5yr and in new nhm_no_dprst
  configurations.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Dunnian flow is implemented (in PRMSSoilzone) and tested for sagehen_5yr.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Preferential flow is implemented (in PRMSSoilzone) and tested for sagehen_5yr.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Control instances have a diff method to compare with other instances.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Feature to standardize subsetting input data (parameters and forcings) in
  space and time either from file (:func:`utils.netcdf_utils.subset_netcdf_file`) or
  in memory (:func:`utils.netcdf_utils.subset_xr`).
  (:pull:`304`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- pref_flow_infil_frac now a required parameter input for PRMSSoilzone. The NHM
  values assumed previously are zeros on all HRUs.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed calculation of the variable transp_on was incorrectly calculated in certain
  situations not covered by NHM configuratons but covered by sagehen_5yr.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Fixed calculation of variable dprst_area_open which was not being checked but
  was affecting no other variables.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- The variable pptmix was incorrectly calculated in certain situations not covered
  by the NHM configurations.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Testing system refactor to handle pairs of domains and control files
  allowing much more flexibility in configuration/control testing.
  (:pull:`278`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- New testing domain "sagehen_5yr" is added to test_data directory
  with configuration sagehen_no_cascades. This domain introduces multiple
  PRMS capabilities (noted indvidually in this PR) not used in the NHM
  configuration and provides a test for these.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Tests are now marked as "domain" or "domainless" to avoid redundant
  runs of domainless tests across test domains.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- New tests test_prms_above_snow and test_prms_below_snow replace
  test_model and are extremely close to PRMS (PRMSSolarGeometry: 1.0e-8,
  PRMSAtmosphere: 1.0e-5, PRMSCanopy: 1.0e-6, PRMSRunoff: 1.0e-8,
  PRMSRunoffNoDprst: 1.0e-8, PRMSSoilzone: 1.0e-8, PRMSSoilzoneNoDprst: 1.0e-8,
  PRMSGroundwater: 1.0e-8, PRMSGroundwaterNoDprst: 1.0e-8, PRMSChannel: 5.0e-7)
  for all test domains.
  (:pull:`288`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Migration to Numpy 2.0+.
  (:pull:`310`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.


.. _whats-new.1.1.0:

v1.1.0 (25 June 2024)
---------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Minor enhancement to ensure PRMSSnow hru_deplcrv parameter is integer or coercable.
  (:pull:`296`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Release assests to include new GIS files and an additional domain to support the upcoming
  major release. By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.


.. _whats-new.1.0.0:

v1.0.0 (18 December 2023)
-------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Control object features including (optional) warnings for unused legacy options, and
  defined and enforced options. Also to_yaml() and __str__ implementations.
  (:pull:`240`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Example notebook of how to edit Parameters with associated bug fixes to do so.
  (:pull:`232`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Conda feedstock for pywatershed `<https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/23428>`_.
  By `Joseph Hughes <https://github.com/jdhughes-usgs>`_.


Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The `control.options` "netcdf_output_dir", "netcdf_output_var_names", and
  "netcdf_output_separate_files" match the keyword arguments "output_dir",
  "output_vars", and "separate_files" for both `process.intitalize_netcdf()`
  and `model.initialize_netcdf()`. None of these arguments can be supplied in
  both places (control and method call). It used to be that calling
  `initialize_netcdf()` would override what is supplied in `control.options`
  but this will now throw an error. The suggestion is to use `control.options` and
  not pass arguments to `intialize_netcdf()`. When using
  `Control.load()` (deprecated) or `Control.load_prms()` from a PRMS control
  file, note that the "control.options" of "netcdf_output_dir" and
  "netcdf_output_var_names" are set by values in the PRMS control file. You can
  edit these, but be aware that they are now set in that load.
  (:pull:`257`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Deprecation of Control.load() for Control.load_prms().
  (:pull:`240`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Mass balance fix in PRMS snow for rain on snow followed by evaporation
  consuming the entire snow pack.
  (:pull:`248`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Fix mass balance issue in PRMSSnow is also present in PRMS,
  snow evap is not taken from freeh2o when there is no pk_ice.
  (:pull:`236`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Resolve issues with different ways of specifying necdf output options.
  (:pull:`230`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Resolve issues with different ways of specifiying netcdf output options.
  (:pull:`230`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- PRMSSoilzone remove soil_moist_prev because soil_moist is not prognotic and
  PRMSRunoff was needing it in the advance and not getting the correct value.
  PRMSRunoff now depends on soil_lower_prev and soil_rechr_prev instead.
  (:pull:`244`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

  This branch publishes analysis supporting the version 1.0.0 release.
- Add about section for version 1.0 to describe how pywatershed matches PRMS'
  NHM configuration and how to perform the comparison.
  (:pull:`244`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New system for generating test_data, by calling generate_test_data.py from
  `autotest/`. The system helps autotest know if test data were generated
  and if they are up to date.
  (:pull:`253`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Apply pylint and flake8 everywhere as much as possible.
  (:pull:`251`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New example notebooks. Moved old notebooks to `examples/developer`.
  (:pull:`204`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- New way to specify `Model` instantiation either in-memory or from yaml files
  using a model dictionary. The approach is loosely based on MODFLOW 6 input
  organization. See `Model` documentation. Introduced the concept of
  discretizations for PRMS, defining "dis_hru" and "dis_seg". These are
  components of how model dictionaries are specified.
  (:pull:`188`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- New `Control.from_yaml()` method. (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Add automatic release workflow to PyPi as per :issue:`178`. Associated
  implementation of gitflow and semver conventions. Overhauled
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `README.md`, and `.github/RELEASE.md`
  to document adopted practices. Adoption of `git-cliff` to generate change
  logs by filtering comitt messages, see `cliff.toml`. Clean up of environment
  files and streamlining against `pyproject.toml`. Symlink gfortran dylibs to
  `/usr/local/lib` on macOS CI so PRMS binaries included in this repo can find
  them. (:pull:`179`)
  By `Wes Bonelli <https://github.com/w-bonelli>`_.


Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Move Control attribute "config" to "options" for handling global options.
  (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Remove arguments from `Model` initialization. Options pass via control, new
  `set_options()` method on Process and ConservativeProcess
  (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- `Control` no longer takes a `Parameter` object as an initialization argument.
  `Process` subclasses now require arguments `discretization` and `parameters`.
  The firstargument of `Model` not a indefinite number of processes, it is now
  either a list of `Process` subclasses or a model dictionary (see `Model`
  documentation. (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
