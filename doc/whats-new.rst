.. _whats-new.1.0.0:

v1.0.0
---------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Control object features including (optional) warnings for unused legacy options, and
  defined and enforced options. Also to_yaml() and __str__ implementations.
  (:pull:`240`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Example notebook of how to edit Parameters with associated bug fixes to do so.
  (:pull:`232`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Conda feedstock for pywatershed `<https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/23428>`_.
  By `Joseph Hughes <https://github.com/jdhughes-usgs>`_.


Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The `control.options` "netcdf_output_dir", "netcdf_output_var_names", and
  "netcdf_output_separate_files" match the keyword arguments "output_dir",
  "output_vars", and "separate_files" for both `process.intitalize_netcdf()`
  and `model.initialize_netcdf()`. None of these arguments can be supplied in
  both places (control and method call). It used to be that calling
  `initialize_netcdf()` would override what is supplied in `control.options`
  but this will now throw an error. The suggestion is to use `control.options` and
  not pass arguments to `intialize_netcdf()`. When using
  `Control.load()` (deprecated) or `Control.load_prms()` from a PRMS control
  file, note that the "control.options" of "netcdf_output_dir" and
  "netcdf_output_var_names" are set by values in the PRMS control file. You can
  edit these, but be aware that they are now set in that load.
  (:pull:`257`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
  
Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Deprecation of Control.load() for Control.load_prms().
  (:pull:`240`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Performance
~~~~~~~~~~~


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Mass balance fix in PRMS snow for rain on snow followed by evaporation
  consuming the entire snow pack.
  (:pull:`248`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Fix mass balance issue in PRMSSnow is also present in PRMS,
  snow evap is not taken from freeh2o when there is no pk_ice.
  (:pull:`236`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Resolve issues with different ways of specifying necdf output options.
  (:pull:`230`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Resolve issues with different ways of specifiying netcdf output options.
  (:pull:`230`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- PRMSSoilzone remove soil_moist_prev because soil_moist is not prognotic and
  PRMSRunoff was needing it in the advance and not getting the correct value.
  PRMSRunoff now depends on soil_lower_prev and soil_rechr_prev instead.
  (:pull:`244`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Implement sphinx_autodoc_typehints.
  (:pull:`257`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.  
- New gh-pages branch (without history) to publish
  `"pywatershed notes" <https://ec-usgs.github.io/pywatershed/>`_ including the
  `extended release notes for v1.0.0 <https://ec-usgs.github.io/pywatershed/2023/11/14/v1-0-0-overview>`_.
  This branch publishes analysis supporting the version 1.0.0 release.
- Add about section for version 1.0 to describe how pywatershed matches PRMS'
  NHM configuration and how to perform the comparison.
  (:pull:`244`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.

Internal changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New system for generating test_data, by calling generate_test_data.py from
  `autotest/`. The system helps autotest know if test data were generated
  and if they are up to date.
  (:pull:`253`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Apply pylint and flake8 everywhere as much as possible.
  (:pull:`251`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Remove diagnostic variables pkwater_equiv_change, pkwater_ante
  (:pull:`248`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Use v1 instead of main for fortran-lang/setup-fortran.
  (:pull:`242`, :pull:`243`) By `Wes Bonelli <https://github.com/w-bonelli>`_.
- Refactor test data generation to solve race condition for dependent tests.
  (:pull:`237`) By `Wes Bonelli <https://github.com/w-bonelli>`_.
- Refactor tests against PRMS for consistency, flexibility, and thoroughness.
  (:pull:`244`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.


.. _whats-new.0.2.1:

v0.2.1 (19 July 2023)
---------------------

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Package data was not properly installed.
  (:pull:`219`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Small addition to notebook 02
  (:pull:`219`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.


.. _whats-new.0.2.0:

v0.2.0 (18 July 2023)
---------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New example notebooks. Moved old notebooks to `examples/developer`.
  (:pull:`204`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- New way to specify `Model` instantiation either in-memory or from yaml files
  using a model dictionary. The approach is loosely based on MODFLOW 6 input
  organization. See `Model` documentation. Introduced the concept of
  discretizations for PRMS, defining "dis_hru" and "dis_seg". These are
  components of how model dictionaries are specified.
  (:pull:`188`) By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- New `Control.from_yaml()` method. (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- What's new workflow (behold!) per :issue:`180` and :pull:`181`
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Add automatic release workflow to PyPi as per :issue:`178`. Associated
  implementation of gitflow and semver conventions. Overhauled
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEVELOPER.md`, `README.md`, and `.github/RELEASE.md`
  to document adopted practices. Adoption of `git-cliff` to generate change
  logs by filtering comitt messages, see `cliff.toml`. Clean up of environment
  files and streamlining against `pyproject.toml`. Symlink gfortran dylibs to
  `/usr/local/lib` on macOS CI so PRMS binaries included in this repo can find
  them. (:pull:`179`)
  By `Wes Bonelli <https://github.com/w-bonelli>`_.


Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Move Control attribute "config" to "options" for handling global options.
  (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- Remove arguments from `Model` initialization. Options pass via control, new
  `set_options()` method on Process and ConservativeProcess
  (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
- `Control` no longer takes a `Parameter` object as an initialization argument.
  `Process` subclasses now require arguments `discretization` and `parameters`.
  The firstargument of `Model` not a indefinite number of processes, it is now
  either a list of `Process` subclasses or a model dictionary (see `Model`
  documentation. (:pull:`188`)
  By `James McCreight <https://github.com/jmccreight>`_.
