## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to refactor and redesign the [PRMS modeling
system](https://www.usgs.gov/software/precipitation-runoff-modeling-system-prms)
while maintaining its functionality. Code modernization is a step towards
unification with [MODFLOW 6 (MF6)](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6).

The following motivations are taken from our
[AGU poster from December 2022](https://agu2022fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=05-E1-C6-40-DF-0D-4D-C7-4E-DE-D2-61-02-05-8F-0A)
which provides additional details on motivations, project status, and current
directions of this project as of approximately January 2023.

Goals of the USGS Enterprise Capacity (EC) project include:
  * A sustainable integrated, hydrologic modeling framework for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
  * Interoperable modeling across the USGS, partner agencies, and academia

Goals for EC Watershed Modeling:
  * Couple the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS, e.g. Regan et al, 2018)  with MODFLOW 6 (MF6, e.g. Langevin et al, 2017) in a sustainable way
  * Redesign PRMS to be more modern and flexible
  * Prioritize process representations in the current National Hydrological Model (NHM) based on PRMS 5.2.1

Prototype an EC watershed model: "pywatershed"
  * Redesign PRMS quickly in python
  * Couple to MF6 via BMI/XMI interface (Hughes et al, 2021; Hutton et al, 2020)
  * Establish a prototyping ground for EC codes that couples to the compiled framework: low cost proof of concepts (at the price of potentially less computational performance)
  * Enable process representation hypothesis testing
  * Use cutting-edge techniques and technologies to improve models
  * Machine learning, automatic differentiation
  * Address challenges of modeling across space and time scales
  * Transition prototype watershed model to compiled EC code

## Installation

To install the software you will need Python 3.9 or 3.10. The `pywatershed` package is [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pywatershed/) and can be installed with:

```
pip install pywatershed
```

A number of extra dependencies are needed to run the example notebooks. These can be installed with pip with

```
pip install "pywatershed[optional]"
```

Alternatively dependencies can be installed with Anaconda or Miniconda. An environment containing all core and optional dependencies can be created from the project root with:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

These installation steps are suitable for `pywatershed` end users. See the [developer documentation](./DEVELOPER.md) for detailed instructions on configuring a development environment.

## Contributing

See the [developer documentation](./DEVELOPER.md) for instructions on setting up a development environment. See the [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute to this project.

## Example Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks containing examples are found in the
[examples/](https://github.com/EC-USGS/pywatershed/tree/main/examples) directory. Numbered notebooks are tested.
Notebooks 00 and 01 walk the user through the setting the python environment and running the software tests.
Notebook 02 demonstrates modeling with pywatershed. Non-numbered notebooks cover additional topics. These notebooks
are note yet covered by testing and so may be expected to have some issues until they are added to testing.
